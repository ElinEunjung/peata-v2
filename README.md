# PEATA: Packages for Easier Access To APIs

**PEATA** is a Python-based research assistant tool that simplifies access to TikTok‚Äôs official Research API. Designed for social science researchers, it provides an intuitive GUI to search, preview and download public TikTok video, comment and user data with minimal technical setup.

More minimalist version built with Tkinter (GUI v1) is available here: https://github.com/amalie246/PEATA

> This version (GUI v2) was independently developed using **PyQt** for a modern and responsive desktop interface. While it shares initial backend logic with GUI v1, the codebase has since been extensively restructured and redesigned to support a more advanced and researcher-friendly experience.

---

## üß© What Makes PEATA Different?

Unlike traditional API tools, PEATA bridges the gap between researchers and complex APIs by offering:

- Real-time query previews
- Modular filter-building tools
- Export-ready data structures (Result table)
- Error-resilient and user-friendly UX

---

## üîç Key Features

- **Flexible Search Mode Architecture**: 
  Built to support both *Simple* and *Advanced* modes across query types.

    ‚úÖ **Video Query**: Advanced mode implemented

    ‚úÖ **Comment Query**: Simple mode implemented

    ‚úÖ **User Info Query**: Simple mode only

   > Internal architecture is fully prepared for future dual-mode expansion.

- **Real-Time Query Preview**: 
  Instantly displays the generated query JSON for easier debugging and transparency.

- **Result Table with ‚ÄúLoad More‚Äù Pagination**: 
  Review data in batches of up to 100 rows before downloading the full dataset - ideal for validating data quality

- **Prefetch Before Export**: 
  Supports quick data inspection through paginated results before downloading all.

- **Dynamic Filter Builder** *(Video Query)*: 
  Combine logic operators (AND/OR/NOT), field operators (EQ, IN, GT...), user defined values (username, keyword...), and region filters for precise control.

- **Customizable Field Selection**: 
  Select from 23+ TikTok fields using grouped checkboxes, tailored to your research needs.

- **Max Results Control**: 
  Select data volume limits to fetch (100 / 500 / 1000 / ALL) for efficient API requests.

- **Progress Tracking**: 
  Visual progress bar during data export operations.

- **Modular and Reusable UI**: 
  Built with consistent, clean PyQt components across query types.

- **Data Export to `.csv` / `.xlsx`**: 
  Download query results in well-structured format with predefined column ordering.

- **Robust Error Handling**: 
  User-friendly error messages with clear recovery paths and API error explanations

- **Standalone Executable (Coming Soon)**: 
  A `.exe` version for Windows users is in development‚Äîno Python required.

## üöÄ Getting Started (For developer)

### üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### üîß Installation

> Coming soon: Executable version for Windows.

To run from source (developer setup):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElinEunjung/PEATA.git
cd PEATA
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m app.main
```

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Use the App
1. **Launch** the app.
2. **Sign in** with valid TikTok Research API credentials. 
3. **Select a query type** from the left menu (Video, Comment, or User) 
4. **Set filters and fields** as needed:
   - In *Video Query*, all available fields are checked by defalut. 
   - ([Query Design Best Practices](#-Best-query practice-guide) coming soon)
5. **Choose result size** using **Max Result** dropdown (default: 500).
   - Selecting more than 1000 will trigger an API quota warning.
6. **Click "Run Query"** to fetch data.
   - If the query is valid, a result table will appear. 
   - If required filters are missing (e.g., date range + at least one additional filter), you‚Äôll see an error message.
7. **Review results** in the table view:
   - Click **"Load More"** to fetch additional results (up to 100 rows at a time.)
   - If the button is missing, it means all available data has been loaded.
   - If the results aren't satisfactory, click **‚ÄúBack to Query‚Äù** to adjust your filters.
8. **Export results** to `.csv` or `.xlsx`:
   - Large datasets take time. 
   - A progress bar will appear (may seem frozen during heavy downloads).  
   - Messages will confirm both successful and failed exports. 
   > Don't worry if the app seems unresponsive during large exports ‚Äî it's working! üòä
9. **Find exported files** in the `/data/` folder (`csv/` or `excel/` subfolder).

## üßº Query Design Best Practices  *(Experimental ‚Äì Needs Further Testing)*

> The logic below is based on observed API behavior and may be updated after further testing.

When filtering videos by `keyword`, it is strongly recommended to combine it with either a `username` or a specific `region_code`. 
Otherwise, the TikTok Research API may return an `invalid_params` error, especially if the query is too broad.

| Condition | Result |
|:---|:---|
| `region_code` + `keyword` (rare keyword, small region) | ‚úÖ  |
| `region_code` + `keyword` (common keyword, large region) | ‚úÖ  |
| `username` + `keyword` | ‚úÖ  |
| `keyword` only | ‚ùå May fail with invalid_params |

**Best practice:** Always start with broad search with single filter. Normally, multiple `keyword` values ensures a successful query.
